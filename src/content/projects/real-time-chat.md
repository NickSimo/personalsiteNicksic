# Building a Real-time Chat Application

## Project Overview

This project involved creating a scalable real-time chat application that could handle thousands of concurrent connections. The system was built using Node.js for the backend, with WebSocket connections for real-time communication, and MongoDB for message persistence.

## Technical Implementation

### WebSocket Architecture
The core of the system relies on WebSocket connections to enable real-time bidirectional communication. We used the 'ws' library for Node.js, implementing a custom protocol for different types of messages:

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
    // Handle different message types
    const { type, payload } = JSON.parse(message);
    switch(type) {
      case 'chat':
        broadcastMessage(payload);
        break;
      case 'typing':
        notifyTyping(payload);
        break;
      // ... other cases
    }
  });
});
```

### Message Persistence
Messages are stored in MongoDB using a schema that allows for efficient querying of chat history:

```javascript
const messageSchema = new Schema({
  roomId: String,
  sender: String,
  content: String,
  timestamp: Date,
  attachments: [{
    type: String,
    url: String
  }]
});
```

### Scaling Considerations

To handle high loads, we implemented several optimization strategies:

1. Connection pooling for database operations
2. Message queuing for handling spikes in traffic
3. Redis for caching frequent queries
4. Horizontal scaling using Node.js cluster module

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was handling reconnections and message delivery guarantees. We solved this by:

1. Implementing a message queue with persistence
2. Creating a robust reconnection strategy
3. Using message acknowledgments
4. Implementing message deduplication

## Performance Metrics

The system currently handles:
- 10,000+ concurrent connections
- Sub-100ms message delivery time
- 99.99% uptime
- 5TB+ of message history

## Future Improvements

Planning to implement:
- End-to-end encryption
- File sharing optimization
- Voice and video chat capabilities
- Advanced search functionality
