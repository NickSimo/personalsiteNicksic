# Building a Video Processing Pipeline

## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a robust video processing pipeline capable of handling multiple video formats and performing real-time transcoding. Here's a demonstration of our system in action:

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Technical Architecture

Our video processing pipeline consists of several key components:

```javascript
const processVideo = async (videoFile) => {
  const pipeline = new Pipeline({
    input: videoFile,
    stages: [
      new VideoDecoder(),
      new FrameProcessor(),
      new VideoEncoder(),
      new StreamPackager()
    ]
  });

  await pipeline.process();
};
```

## Key Features

### Real-time Processing

Watch how our system handles real-time video processing:

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### Performance Metrics

- Processing speed: 60fps
- Multiple format support
- Real-time streaming
- Low latency delivery

## Future Improvements

We're working on adding:
- AI-powered video analysis
- Advanced compression algorithms
- Cloud-based processing
- Multi-device synchronization

## Implementation Details

The system uses a combination of technologies:
- Node.js for the backend
- FFmpeg for video processing
- WebRTC for streaming
- Redis for caching

## Conclusion

This video processing pipeline demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to build sophisticated media processing systems.
